# The Cocktail Finder

This Cocktail finder is intended to allow a user to find recipes for cocktails and showcase the work of Corri Naglie, Francis Derosier, and Sawyer Baldwin.

## Description
        This Cocktail Finder application was intended to provide users with a way to search ingredients and save their favorite recipes. Additionally, this project used our knowledge as bootcamp students and showcased all the aspects of coding design that we have learned so far.
## Usage
        The Cocktail Finder is used by selecting the ingredient thats desired to be in a cocktail and pressing search. Then the page will search to find one or more cocktails and present them in a list for you to choose from. Once you decide from the list of cocktails simply click the desired name and you will be directed to the page with the direction on how to make the selected cocktail. You can also be suprized with a random cocktail if you dont have a favorite ingredient to select. Simply press the Random Search button and youll be directed to a completely random cocktail. Every recipe page also has a random joke to give you some enetertainment while making the cocktail. If you try a cocktail and would like to save the recipe, press the save button thats on any page.

## Conclusion
During the creation of this application we learned and sharpened many coding skills that will be invaluable in future jobs involving computer software engineering and design. The skills used/learned include:

* Learned to research and implement javaScript, CSS, and HTML solutions to achive our end product.

* Learned to collaborate and further improve our understanding of Git hub and the usage of pull requests and code review.

* Further implemented skills learned in class such as linking and using thrid party API's, proper use of local storage, and usage of CSS styling languages (Tailwind in our case).

* Gained a more analytical mind set when viewing code, specifically to critque and understand other's contributions to prevent issues in the page.

* Acheived a better understanding of jquery sytax.
