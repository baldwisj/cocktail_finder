Then the page will search to find one or more cocktails and present them in a list for you to choose from.

You can also be suprized with a random cocktail if you dont have a favorite ingredient to select. Simply press the Random Search button and youll be directed to a completely random cocktail. Every recipe page also has a random joke to give you some enetertainment while making the cocktail. If you try a cocktail and would like to save the recipe, press the save button thats on any page.
